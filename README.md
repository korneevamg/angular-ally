# AngularA11y

Accessibility is back in, thanks to the Barrierefreiheitsst√§rkungsgesetz (BFSG)! By 2025 at the latest, we should be able to make our apps accessible.

This repository contains a demo project for a book store, along with a series of exercises that aim to teach web developers how to make their websites more accessible to people with disabilities. The exercises are designed for developers with basic knowledge of Git, Angular, HTML, Typescript and SCSS. Cypress and Jest knowledge is also helpful but not required. If oyu ar einterested in a plain JS, HTML and CSS showcase, check out [my other repository](https://github.com/BrowserA11y/a11y-workshop).
The demo project consists of a simple Angular app that allows users to browse and store books. The application utilizes the [bookmonkey-api package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/bookmonkey-api) to make requests to the backend server and retrieve book information. The website includes various accessibility features, such as alternative text for images and a keyboard-accessible navigation menu. The topics cover accessibility aspects in general web development and in Angular projects.

## Exercises

The exercises in this repository are divided into several sections, each covering a different aspect of web accessibility. Some of the topics covered include:

- Semantic HTML
- Alternative text for non-textual elements
- Keyboard accessibility
- Focus management
- ARIA attributes
- Color contrast
- Responsive design

Angular specifics include:

- Router capability
- Accessibility CDK
- Form handling
- Angular ESLint

The exercises are designed to be completed in order, as they build upon each other. The solutions are tagged.

## Prerequisites

- node (^18.13.0 || ^20.9.0) and npm installed
- Nice-to-have: Chrome installed

## Getting started

- Run `npm i` to install dependencies.
- Run `npx bookmonkey-api` to start fake backend.
- Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Running tests

To start end-to-end tests, run the following command: `npm run cypress`. This will open an interactive UI where you can start the test. More info in the [documentation](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/getting-started/opening-the-app).
Alternativelly, you can run the tests via CLI with `npx cypress run`.
